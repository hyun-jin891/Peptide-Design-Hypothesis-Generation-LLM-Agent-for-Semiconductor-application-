Sequencing of positives identified a short disulfide-constrained loop CFG(W/Y/F)C as a well-defined consensus motif. A peptide with the sequence DVPCFGWCQDA (referred to as paionin-1 hereafter) was synthesized. The paionin-1 sequence is a chimaera of clones A (CDPPCFGWCQDAC) and B (CDVPCFGWCVAWC) devoid of the flanking cysteine residues, which might be not essential as indicated by the clone G (ILCFGMC). The paionin-1 peptide inhibited the PAI-1 binding of phage clone B, while a linear version paionin-1 with the two cysteine residues replaced by serines had no effect on binding. This suggested that the constraint imposed by the disulfide locked the CFGWC loop in a conformation required for binding or that the cysteines were of contact residues. The binding of paionin-1 to PAI-1 was evaluated further through competition experiments with vitronectin. The results showed that vitronectin significantly inhibited the binding of paionin-1 to PAI-1. Therfore, vitronectin was taken as the template of this set of mimotopes.",,,,"0/0/0",,"NO","",""

Although this semiquantitative assay cannot provide kinetic constants, it can provide an accurate rank ordering of the lability of the substrate phage clones. Under the most stringent conditions examined, 11 of the 100 substrate phage, containing eight distinct randomized hexamer sequences (RKASLS, RNAQVR, RRAVSN, RSAKVD, RSANAI, RSATRD, RSAVVK and RSSSSH), proved to be particularly labile u-PA substrates. Besides, four peptides (RSANAI, RNAQVR, RSATRD and RKASLS) were chosen for detailed kinetic analysis and compared with the hydrolysis of a control peptide containing the P3–P4' sequence of plasminogen. All four of the selected peptides were substantially improved substrates for u-PA, by factors of 840–5300, compared with the control, plasminogen peptide (kcat/Km, 0.88 1/Ms).

The wells incubated with negative clones remained nearly colorless. The absorbance was shown. Besides, synthetic peptides representing the individual phage families were analyzed for the ability to inhibit the binding of 14G2a mAb to GD2-positive IMR-32 neuroblastoma cell. Varying amounts of the competitors were incubated overnight with 14G2a antibody (1 μg/mL).

In vivo, SFSIIHTPILPL phage homed specifically to tumor tissues but not to normal visceral organs in severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing human hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts. This homing ability could be competitively inhibited by synthetic peptide, SFSIIHTPILPL. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed that SFSIIHTPILPL phage localized to tumor tissues and that it could not be detected in SFSIIHTPILPL-competed tumor tissues. In addition, SFSIIHTPILPL phage recognized the tumor tissue but not nontumor tissue in surgical specimens from hepatocellular carcinoma patients, with a positive rate of 61.3% (19 of 31). With the conjugation of SFSIIHTPILPL and liposomal doxorubicin, the targeted drug delivery system enhanced the therapeutic efficacy against hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts through enhanced tumor apoptosis and decreased tumor angiogenesis.

Nineteen phage sequences emerged multiple times after DNA sequencing (Top19 sequences). Of the 19 clones, 17 were found in more than 1 experiment on the same substrate, either BLM or HA. Of these 17 phage clones, 7 had high affinity towards both BLM and HA (Top7 sequences). Ten of the identified phage were analyzed using a modified ELISA on BLM films, HA disks, PLGA films and tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) wells at 4 phage dilutions. Low adsorption of the selected phage to TCPS and PLGA compared to HA and BLM illustrates the identified phage have specificity to apatite-based substrates. Of the 10 peptides tested, favorable phage binding was observed for all sequences except SSLGLTVSSIMY, VSPLSFGSPRYP and WSPAPHVIMGTT. On the other hand, the peptides having the highest affinity and greatest potential for adsorption on HA disks and BLM films include APWHLSSQYSRT, STLPIPHEFSRE and VTKHLNQISQSY. The peptide VTKHLNQISQSY is similar in composition to regions found in fibromodulin, lumican and decorin. Overall, STLPIPHEFSRE and VTKHLNQISQSY have a significantly higher adsorption to the apatite-based materials in comparison to APWHLSSQYSRT. Pay attention to STLPIPHEFSRE. This sequence occurred only once in the 3 phage display experiments; however, it was also included into the ""multiple times"" group by the authors.","ELISA","To determine the binding efficiency of the identified phage to the bone-like substrate materials, an ELISA was performed on BLM films, HA disks, PLGA films, and tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) wells.

HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibody was prepared in 1:5000 ratio in blocking buffer and added to each well. An aliquot of each well was read on an UV Spectrophotometer (Biorad SmartSpec 3000) at 410 nm.

CRRETAWAC appears to interact with the same or an overlapping binding site in integrin alpha5/beta1 as RGD.

In vivo, treatment with paclitaxel has been shown to lead to Bcl-2 inactivation with concomitant phosphorylation of residues in a disordered, regulatory loop region of the protein.

Under these conditions, all Ig molecules should be bound on the tube surface. A negative control was incubated with PBS only. The coated tubes were washed with 2.5 mL blocking buffer once (5% [w/v] non‐fat dry milk powder in PBS) and incubated with 4 mL blocking buffer at 4°C for at least 15 minutes under constant agitation. Before adding the ENTE‐1 peptide phage display library, the tubes were washed three times with 4 mL PBS. To preferably select patient-specific antibodies, and in particular to prevent selection of peptides binding serum proteins, a competition with a mixture of ten sera from healthy donors was conducted. The ENTE‐1 library was added to each tube in 1 mL blocking buffer containing 30 μg of non‐allergic serum protein. In the first selection round, an amount of phage corresponding to 4e11 colony forming units (cfu) of ENTE‐1 library and in the second selection only e9‐e10 cfu of recovered phage were used. Tubes were incubated for 2 hour at 4°C with constant agitation, washed five times with 1 mL 0.1% (v/ v) Tween 20 in PBS in the first selection round, and with 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS in the second selection round.","Illumina MiSeq","Next generation sequencing","2","30267550",,,,"Bifang He","28/5/2019","Yuwei Zhou","YES","Michael Szardenings","Michael.szardenings@izi.fraunhofer.de"

In terms of functional properties, NQR and RGD, but not ADK, suppressed arthritis. ADK peptide apparently binds to a receptor that does not trigger a detectable tissue response. The antiarthritic activity of NQR is likely attributable, at least in part, to inhibition of angiogenesis and resulting inhibition of leukocyte migration into the inflamed joint.",,,,"0/0/0",,"NO","",""

Fluorescent microscopic analysis revealed that the TDA1 could be specifically localized in the hair follicles of the skin, as well as in the visceral adipose tissue. Thus, the authors inferred that dermally administered TDA1 would first access systemic circulation via hair follicles as its transdermal route and then could target visceral fat effectively.

Next, the specific binding ability of synthesized peptide A54 was further confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, competition binding, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay. A54 and A54M (sequence AGKGTAALETTP) were synthesized and coupled to doxorubicin (DOX) to do the preliminary targeting therapy. After the treatment, the proliferation of liver cancer cells treated with A54-DOX was restrained significantly in vitro when compared with A54M-DOX-treated group. Reduction in tumor size and prolongation of long-term survival were also found in xenograft-bearing models compared with free DOX-treated group. In conclusion, the specific binding peptide A54, which was screened from phage display library, represents a promising approach for the development of novel target therapy strategies against hepatocellular carcinoma.","ELISA","Phage binding assay was performed by using cell-based ELISA. The absorbance at 450 nm was determined. Selectivity is calculated using the following formula: Selectivity = (ODS1-ODC1)/(ODS2-ODC2). Here, ODS1 and ODC1 represent the values of the binding to BEL-7402 cells by the selected phage and control phage, respectively; ODS2 and ODC2 represent the values of the binding to control cell line HL-7702 by the selected phage and control phage, respectively. The phages with selectivity above 2 are considered to be positive clones. Phage clones A54, A67, and B2 seemed to have the most specific binding ability in cell-based ELISA.

The fluorescent characterization for the binding of TLHPAAD to a flat epoxy surface was investigated. Significantly, the surface with peptide-displaying phages shows much higher fluorescent intensity relative to the one incubated with M13 phages (without phage displayed peptides on the coat). Further, we investigated the localized binding of phage displayed peptide (TLHPAAD) to epoxy microstructures. The epoxy microstructures on glass were generated by using stencil masks to cover epoxy, followed by plasma oxidation. The phage displayed peptides were then allowed to bind to these epoxy microstructures, and the bindings were characterized with fluorescent characterization. Significantly, stronger fluorescent signals were observed localized on the epoxy patterns, relative to the glass substrate. This result clearly indicates that the microstructured epoxy in parts enhanced binding affinity toward phage displayed peptides over the host glass substrate.",,"",,"0/0/0",,"NO","",""

The peptidelinked liposomes containing fluorescent substance were capable of translocating across the plasma membrane through endocytosis. With the conjugation of peptides and liposomal doxorubicin, the targeted drug delivery systems enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent against human cancer xenografts by decreasing tumor angiogenesis and increasing cancer cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the peptide-mediated targeting liposomes improved the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug they delivered compared with nontargeting liposomes or free drugs.

The tumor homing of both peptides was strongly reduced after coinjection with unlabeled CLT2 (CNAGESSKNC), indicating that the two peptides recognize the same binding site. The CLT peptide fluorescence colocalized with staining for fibrin(ogen) present in the extravascular compartment of tumors, but not in other tissues. The CLT peptides did not home to tumors grown in fibrinogen-null mice or in mice that lack plasma fibronectin. The CLT peptides also accumulated at the sites of injury in arteries, skeletal muscle, and skin. It is concluded that the CLT peptides recognize fibrin–fibronectin complexes formed by clotting of plasma proteins that have leaked into the extravascular space in tumors and other lesions.

Furthermore, when the F1 and the gp125 peptides were coupled to bovine serum albumin and screened against 216 serum samples, there were dramatic improvements in sensitivities (95% and 92%, respectively) and little cross-reactivity with the other peptides encountered during acute viral infections, including rheumatoid factor. This study shows the potential for the use of peptide mimotopes as alternatives to the complex antigens used in current serodiagnostics for EBV infection.",,,,"0/0/0",,"NO","",""

The increasing concentrations of Tween-20 were as follows: 0.1 % for second round, 0.3 % for third round and 0.5 % for fourth round in the TBS buffer. Then tumor tissues were resected from the mouse and homogenized in 1 mL of cold TBS containing 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Tech and Innovation Co., Ltd, Seoul, Korea) on ice.

The precleared solution was added to a new tube containing 6His-AHR-N△515 and HisTag Dynabeads. The biopanning process was performed three times to generate the final phage solution. A secondary screening was performed as follows: a LI-COR nitrocellulose membrane (Lincoln, NE) was used for membrane lift to create a mirror image of the individual colonies on the membrane. This membrane was subjected to denaturation/neutralization, and then the membrane was dried and blocked. The blocked membrane was incubated with the IRDye800-conjugated 6HisAHRN△515. After incubation, the membrane was washed, followed by LI-COR Odyssey analysis to detect the colonies bound with AHR-ND515 according to the near IR fluorescence intensity.",,"Sanger sequencing","3","26970402","Eight 12mer peptides, in the form of GFP fusion, suppressed the ligand-dependent transcription of six AHR target genes (cyp1a1, cyp1a2, cyp1b1, ugt1a1, nqo1 and ahrr) in different patterns in Hep3B cells, whereas the AHR antagonist CH223191 suppressed all these target genes similarly. Three of the 12mer peptides (EAESRVYRPGTS, FPPIFAEATARS and TRRAFGSSFRLS) suppressed the 3MC-induced, CYP1A1-dependent EROD activity and the ROS production caused by benzo[a]pyrene.

Accumulation into xenograft tumors in a nude mouse model was analyzed with FITC-labeled NYZL1. NYZL1, with strong tumor-homing ability, was identified by in vivo phage library selection in the bladder cancer model. The NYZL1 phage and synthetic FITC-labeled NYZL1 peptides bound to tumor tissues and cells, but were hardly detected in normal control organs. Notably, accumulation of FITC-NYZL1 in bladder tumor cells was time-dependent. Biodistribution studies of xenografts of BIU-87 cells showed accumulation of injected FITC-NYZL1 in the tumors, and the bound peptide could not be removed by perfusion after 24 h. The mouse model of bladder tumor showed increased fluorescence intensity in the tumor-bearing bladder in comparison with normal bladder tissues after 4-6 h.

The ability of the isolated phage clone to interact specifically with S. aureus and the  efficacy of its bacteria-binding  properties were established by using enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay  (ELISA). We also demonstrated by Western blot analysis that the most reactive and selective phage peptide binds a 78 KDa protein on the bacterial cell surface. Furthermore, we observed selectivity of phage–bacteria-binding allowing to  identify clinical isolates of S. aureus in comparison with a panel of other  bacterial species. In order to explore the possibility of realizing a selective bacteria biosensor device, based on  immobilization of affinity-selected  phage, we have studied the physisorbed phage deposition onto a mica surface. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was used to determine the organization of phage on mica surface and then the binding performance of mica-physisorbed phage to bacterial target was evaluated during the time by fluorescent microscopy. The system is able to bind specifically about 50% of S. aureus cells after 15' and 90% after one hour. Due to  specificity and rapidness, this  biosensing strategy paves the way to the further development of new cheap  biosensors to be used in developing countries, as lab-on-chip (LOC) to  detect bacterial agents in clinical diagnostics applications. ","ELISA","Phage particles bearing no recombinant insert, from superinfection of phagemid vector pC89-containing cells, served as a negative control for evaluation of   background from non-specific binding.The ability of the isolated phage clone to interact specifically with S. aureus and the efficacy of its bacteria-binding  properties were established by ELISA on a kinetic plate reader at 405 nm.","Lixu Jiang","22/7/2017",,"","Salvatore P.P.

The delivery efficiency and the anti-IAV effects of the conjugated molecule were evaluated in a cell culture and a mouse infection model. The conjugated molecule was successfully delivered into IAV-infected host cells more efficiently than the anti-IAV ODN in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the conjugated molecule protected 80% of the mice from lethal challenge and inhibited the plaque count by 75%, compared to the un-conjugated molecule (60% and 40%).

In vivo optical imaging of phage homing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of peptide-SPIONs revealed that HSP1 was the most favorable probe for multimodal molecular imaging. Using HSP1-SPION, the T2-weighted MR signal of H460 xenografts was decreased up to 42%. In contrast to the tight binding of HSP1 to cancer cell surfaces, NNPWREMMYIEI was preferentially endocytosed and intracellular drug delivery was thereby effected, significantly improving the therapeutic index of liposomal drug in vivo. Liposomal doxorubicin (LD) conjugated to GAMHLPWHMGTL, NPWEEQGYRYSM or NNPWREMMYIEI had significantly greater therapeutic efficacy than non-targeting liposomal drugs in NSCLC (H460 and H1993) animal models. Combined therapy with an NNPWREMMYIEI-conjugated stable formulation of liposomal vinorelbine (sLV) further improved median overall survival (131 vs. 84 days; P = 0.0248), even in aggressive A549 orthotopic models.

BRASIL allows separation of phage-cell complexes from the remaining unbound phage; this is accomplished by a differential centrifugation that drives the cells from a hydrophilic environment into a non-miscible organic phase. Because the organic phase is hydrophobic, it excludes water-soluble materials surrounding cell surfaces. Bound phage are recovered from the cell pellet whereas the unbound phage remain soluble in the upper aqueous phase, eliminating the need for repeated washes. A two-step panning strategy to isolate phage that bind to angiogenic ECs was used. First, to decrease non-specific binding, we pre-cleared the phage library on starved ECs (before panning on the same cell line stimulated with recombinant VEGF165); starved human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) were incubated with the phage library and centrifuged through the organic phase. Second, the unbound phage pool left in the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and incubated with VEGF165-stimulated HUVECs. After centrifugation through the organic phase, phage bound to the VEGF165-stimulated HUVEC pellet were recovered by bacterial infection, amplified and subjected to two more rounds of selection.",,"Sanger sequencing","3","11689892","The motif PQPRPL is a novel chimeric ligand mimic that binds specifically to VEGF receptor-1 and to neuropilin-1.",,,"Lixu Jiang","19/1/2018",,"NO","Wadih Arap

Synthesized PFT exhibited specific binding to CD44v6 with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 743.4 nM. PFT also bound CD44v6 highly expressed on human PCa cell lines. Further, an aggressive form of PCa cells (v6A3) was isolated and tagged by a novel CSC reporter vector. The v6A3 cells had a CSC-like phenotype including enriched CD44v6 expression, enhanced clonogenicity, resistance to chemotherapeutics, and generation of heterogeneous offspring. PFT exhibited preferential binding to v6A3 cells compared to parental cells. Immunohistofluorescence studies with human PCa tissue microarrays (TMA) indicated that PFT was highly accurate in detecting CD44v6 positive aggressive PCa cells, and staining positivity was significantly higher in late stage, metastatic and higher-grade samples. Taken together, this study provides for the first time phage display selected peptides that target CD44v6 overexpressed on PCa cells. Peptide PFT may be explored as an aid in the diagnosis and therapy of advanced PCa disease.","ELISA","Eleven phage clones with the highest selection frequency and unique sequences were chosen for analysis of their ability to bind the v6 region peptide using phage ELISA.

Deep sequencing of the peptide-encoding inserts in the selected phage pool revealed enrichment of the peptide CSPGAKVRC (codenamed “UNO”). Intravenously injected FAM-labeled UNO (FAM-UNO) homed to tumor and sentinel lymph node MEMs in different cancer models: 4T1 and MCF-7 breast carcinoma, B16F10 melanoma, WT-GBM glioma and MKN45-P gastric carcinoma. Fluorescence anisotropy assay showed that FAM-UNO interacts with recombinant CD206 when subjected to reducing conditions. Interestingly, the GSPGAK motif is present in all CD206-binding collagens. FAM-UNO was able to transport drug-loaded nanoparticles into MEMs, whereas particles without the peptide were not taken up by MEMs. In ex vivo organ imaging, FAM-UNO showed significantly higher accumulation in sentinel lymph nodes than a control peptide.

Mutant LARFH seemed to interact with platinum through its loop containing the YKRGYK sequence, as judged by the estimated exclusive area occupied by a single molecule. Furthermore, a 10-residue peptide containing the YKRGYK sequence bound to platinum with reasonably high afﬁnity and basic side chains in the peptide were crucial in mediating this interaction. In conclusion, we have identiﬁed an amino acid sequence, YKRGYK, in the loop of a helix-loop-helix motif that shows high platinum-binding afﬁnity. This sequence could be grafted into loops of other polypeptides as an approach to immobilize proteins on platinum electrodes for use as biosensors among other applications.","Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)","The interaction of YKRGYK with a platinum surface was monitored and quantiﬁed by usinga hand-made flow-quartz crystal microbalance system (f-QCM) with a custom-made acryl ﬂow cell equipped with 9-MHz Pt or Au quartz crystals (Kyocera, Japan).

In an adhesion assay of epithelial cells on A10-treated titanium, PAR4-AP-treated titanium, bovine root and non-treated titanium, A10-treated titanium and PAR4-AP-treated titanium showed significantly stronger adhesion than non-treated titanium. PAR4-AP-treated titanium showed significantly higher inflammatory cytokine release than non-treated titanium. There was no significant difference in inflammatory cytokine release between A10-treated and non-treated titanium.

Conservative substitutions of terminal residues of the lead peptide led to a second peptide, RVRSFY, which was more efficient in the affinity chromatographic purification of vWF from protein mixtures. Adsorption isotherm measurements indicated multiple interactions between vWF and the immobilized peptide RVRSFY. Increases in peptide density on the chromatographic supports resulted in stronger association constants and higher maximum protein binding capacities. When the peptide density was lower than 32 mg/mL, there was no measurable interaction between vWF and immobilized peptide RVRSFY in HEPES buffer containing 0.5 M NaCI at pH 7. An increase in peptide density from 32 to 60 mg/mL increased the association constants from 0.9e6 to 2e6 (1/M). Divalent salts (calcium and magnesium chloride) were used to elute the retained vWF with 82.5% of the activity recovered. The interactions between vWF and the immobilized peptide RVRSFY are dominated by ionic attractions and also involve hydrophobic interactions at close contact. Finally, the purification of vWF from crude material PEG filtrate of a cryoprecipitate of human plasma is demonstrated using affinity chromatography with immobilized N-acetyl-RVRSFYK.",,,"Bifang He","29/1/2019",,"NO","Ruben G.

Mineral dispersions were incubated together with the phage and subsequently repeatedly washed, resulting in the removal of weakly bound phage. Phage concentrations in input and eluate were determined and compared to the binding behavior of wild-type fd-tet phage (obtained by Dr. Jamie Scott). Binding efficiency was calculated using phage titer before and after binding assays in comparison to the wild-type phage.","Zhongjie Tang","29/1/2019",,"NO","Robert Braun","r.braun@hzdr.de"

This affinity peptide (AFP) agglutinated or disrupted virion particles, inhibiting RBS entry into sea bass (SB) cells. To enhance BC and solubility, we amended the AFP sequence as “LHWDFQSWVPLL” and named as 12C. One to three copies of 12C in tandem were prokaryotically expressed with a maltose binding protein (MBP) linked by a flexible peptide. Of the recombinant proteins expressed, MBP-triple-12C (MBP-T12C) exhibited the highest BC, efficiently blocked RBS entry, and strongly inhibited OGNNV infection at viral entry. Moreover, MBP-T12C bound the VLPs of all nervous necrosis virus (NNV) serotypes, displaying broad-spectrum anti-NNV ability, and recognized only OGNNV and mud crab virus, demonstrating binding specificity. Therefore, these anti-NNV AFPs specifically bound NNV, aggregating or disrupting the viral particles, to reduce the contact probability between the virus and cell surface, subsequently inhibiting viral infection.

In addition, the expression of A20, pAkt, and pNFkb (pRelA536) in C666-1 cells treated with B1.12 decreased compared to the untreated cells. In conclusion, we selected a novel peptide able to bind specifically to the extracellular loop of LMP1 and thus modulate its oncogenic properties.","ELISA","Binding of the B1.12 peptide to its target B1 was evaluated by phage ELISA. Blocking buffer without B1 peptide was used as negative control. All experiments were done in triplicate and the binding of the phage clones to the B1 target was calculated according to the following formula: binding = OD phage/OD control × 100, where OD control and OD phage represent the OD410 nm values of phage binding with negative control and with B1 peptide, respectively.

Unbound phages were removed by washing 10 times in 1.5 ml of 1M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS, pH 7.2 and two subsequent washes with 1.5 ml PBS. The Ni-NTA beads were then resuspended in 375 μl PBS. The purified CP (CP16160, ~800 ng) was added to the resuspended Ni-NTA beads to digest the susceptible phage nanopeptides under gentle agitation at 37 °C for 2 h. PBS without added enzyme was used as control. After 2 h incubation, phages with random peptide that was susceptible to protease cleavage were released from Ni-NTA matrix, and the supernatant containing these phages was recovered. To ensure that all of the released phages were recovered, the beads were re-suspended in 100 μl PBS (pH 7.2) and the supernatant, after mixing and centrifugation, was added to the first supernatant. To ensure that the His6-tags had been hydrolyzed on all phages recovered after protease digestion, 15 μl fresh Ni–NTA agarose beads were added to the combined phage supernatant and the mixture agitated for 15 min followed by centrifugation. A control elution of the phages still bound to the beads, using 100 μl 100 mM imidazole showed that at least 1e8 phages were attached to the matrix during each selection. 10 μl of the supernatant containing the released phages were used to determine the amount of phages detached in each round of selection. Dilutions of the supernatant were plated in 2.5 ml of 0.6% top agarose containing 300 μl of Escherichia coli (BLT5615), 100 μl diluted supernatant and 100 μl 100 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The remaining volume of the supernatant was added to a 10 ml culture of BLT5615 (OD ~0.6). The bacteria had 30 min prior to phage addition been induced to produce the T7 phage capsid protein by the addition of 100 μl 100 mM IPTG to the culture. The bacteria were lysed ~75 min after phage addition.

The feasibility of PLSWT7-DMI–based dual-modality photoacoustic imaging near-infrared (PAI-NIR) imaging was assessed in vitro, in mouse models, and ex vivo human bladders. An air-pouch bladder cancer (APBC) model suitable for probe instillation was established to evaluate the probe-based bladder cancer PAI diagnosis and NIR-imaging–guided resection. Human bladders were used to assess whether the PLSWT7-DMI–based DMI strategy is a translatable approach for bladder cancer detection and resection. The probe exhibited excellent selectivity and specificity both in vitro and in vivo. Postinstillation of the probe, tumors <3mm were detectable by PAI, and NIR-imaging–guided tumor resection decreased the bladder cancer recurrence rate by 90% and increased the survival in the mouse model. Additionally, ex vivo NIR imaging of human bladders indicated that PLSWT7-DMI–based imaging would potentially allow precise resection of bladder cancer in clinical settings. This PLSWT7-DMI–based DMI strategy was a translatable approach for bladder cancer diagnosis and resection and could potentially lower the bladder cancer recurrence rate.","ELISA","For ELISA, RT112 and human normal urothelial cell line SV-HUC-1SV-HUC-1 were plated at 1.0e4 cells/well in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 24 hours.

Strikingly, LN1 specifically bound to the tumor tissue and exhibited very low reactivity with normal liver and kidney tissues. To demonstrate that LN1 could specifically deliver drugs to prostate cancer tissue, a therapeutic peptide, LN1-KLA (C-TGTPARQ-CGGG-D[KLAKLAK]2), was prepared and used to treat LNCaP cells in vitro and was also administered to tumor-bearing mice.

PD-L1Pep-1 and PD-L1Pep-2 preferentially bound to high PD-L1-expressing cells over low PD-L1-expressing cells; binding was further enhanced by interferon-γ, an inducer of PD-L1 expression. Binding affinities of PD-L1Pep-1 and PD-L1Pep-2 were approximately 373 and 281 nM, respectively. Cellular binding of the PD-L1-binding peptides was reduced by silencing PD-L1 gene expression or competition with anti-PD-L1 antibody. PD-L1Pep-1 and PD-L1Pep-2 induced the internalization and downregulated cell surface levels of PD-L1. The PD-L1-binding peptides restored cytokine secretion and T-cell proliferation to cells inhibited by co-culture with tumor cells or culture on PD-L1-coated plates. Intravenously injected PD-L1Pep-1 and PD-L1Pep-2 efficiently homed to tumor tissues, inhibited tumor growth, and increased CD8+/FoxP3+ ratio in mice. The PD-L1-binding peptides in combination with doxorubicin or PD-L1-targeted liposomal doxorubicin inhibited tumor growth and increased CD8+/FoxP3+ ratio more efficiently than doxorubicin alone and untargeted liposomal doxorubicin, respectively. These results suggest that PD-L1Pep-1 and PD-L1Pep-2 block PD-L1 and reinvigorate T-cell activity, inhibiting tumor growth by enhancing anti-tumor immunity.","Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)","The binding affinity (KD, nM) of PD-L1-binding peptides was measured by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method using an SPR instrument (Reichert Technologies, Depew, NY) at 25 °C.

The best reactivity, evaluated by phage ELISA, was that of clone B6, which showed good AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and LR.
